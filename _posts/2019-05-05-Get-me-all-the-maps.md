# Storyline
It all started with a simple question from my beloved girlfriend: "Is it possible to download the entire map from this page?". Okok...we have to look back a little bit. She was asked by a friend of ours to scan an old map of an area in the local university library.

But: Scanning such a massive picture would cost ~40 Euro and nobody was willing to pay that. I can understand that nearly every scan could damage the map, so, wouldn't it be a better option to use an already scanned one?

The search began and it was successful. A [Czech website](http://chartae-antiquae.cz/) old maps had this map in it's entirety on their page.

The only crux: It was in tiles and viewable like google maps. No complete picture in high resolution was anywhere to be found.

# The search for all the pictures
If you look into the loading of the pictures though, you clearly can see the naming convention.

![loading of pictures]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/2019/Selection_042.png)

It is a pretty easy one as well, `$zoomlevel-$x-$y.jpg`. puh, we are in luck.

Now we have 86 rows and 71 columns to deal with, resulting in ~6300 pictures.
That makes a hell lot of pictures and a lot of requests to this server.

# Downloading individual pictures
Let's just plug that into a double for-loop and download it. Easy enough.

Side-note: They are even nice enough to open this up through an Access-control-allow-origin wildcard.

![access control allow origin wildcard]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/2019/Selection_043.png)

It's never that easy...NEVER!

## Subdirectories
If you look closer at all the pictures, the URL isn't as clear as i made it out to be. In fact it looks like: `http://$server/TileGroup0/7-1-0.jpg`. There are subdirectories named TileGroups: `/TileGroup%d/7-%d-%d.jpg`. TileGroups are predictable, but i am to lazy to reverse that. Therefore, i remember the last TileGroup, i am in and increment that, if i can't find the relevant file in this TileGroup.

It is a nicer brute force at this point.

```python
import requests
import time
import os
import sys

NAME = ""
URL = "http://$server/"
MAX_TITLE_GROUPS = 32
MAX_X = 86
MAX_Y = 71

first_find = 0 # Last TileGroup
fileLoaded = False

headers = {
    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/73.0.3683.103 Safari/537.36',
    'Referer': 'http://chartae-antiquae.cz/'  # This is another valid field
}

with open("%s.log" % (NAME),'rb') as fh:
    first_find = int(fh.read())
    fileLoaded = True
    os.remove("%s.log" % (NAME))

for x in range(MAX_X+1):
    if not fileLoaded:
        first_find = 0

    for y in range(MAX_Y+1):
        for i in range(first_find,MAX_TITLE_GROUPS+1):
            if os.path.isfile("%s/7-%d-%d.jpg" % (NAME,x,y)):
                print("7-%d-%d.jpg already downloaded" % (x,y))
                break

            url = URL+"/TileGroup%d/7-%d-%d.jpg" % (i,x,y)
            try:
                r = requests.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=2)
                print("[%d] %s" % (r.status_code, url))
                if r.status_code == 200:
                    first_find = i
                    fileLoaded = False
                    open("%s/7-%d-%d.jpg" % (NAME,x,y), 'wb').write(r.content)
                    time.sleep(1.5)
                    break
                else:
                    time.sleep(1)
            except:
                print("WTF WENT WRONG")
                open("%s.log" % (NAME),'wb').write(str(first_find))
                sys.exit(1)
```

But wait. There is more.

## Rate Limiting
You could have guessed it: they have rate limiting against scum like me. It is an annoyance and i didn't find any good way around it. I tried random sleeps, waiting long enough, referrer, user-agents, etc. But the script failed now and then. Nothing worked. Therefore it keeps a log and checks all the already downloaded files.

The easiest option was to check the exit code of the python script and retry after 10sec. Easy and Dirty.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

until python get.py; do
    echo "Retry in 10sec"
    sleep 10
done;
```

# What about ~6k 25x25px pictures
I downloaded about ~6300 pictures which are already in a perfect shape. I have the position in the grid and just have to assemble them.  
`convert` to the rescue! I could have used PIL or similar python libraries, but c'mon...why not just use a simple bash script to assemble.

![individual pictures]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/2019/Selection_044.png)

It assembles individual columns and assembles all columns into one big picture.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ -z "${1}" ]; then
    echo "Usage: ${0} <directory>"
    exit 1;
fi;

mkdir -p "${1}/merged.layer.1/"
rm "${1}/merged.layer.1/*.jpg"

if [ -f "${1}.jpg" ]; then
    rm "${1}.jpg"
fi;

highest=$(ls ${1}/*.jpg | sort -V | tail -n 1 | awk -F- '{print $2}')

for i in `seq 0 $highest`; do
  convert -append $(ls -1 "${1}/7-$i-*.jpg" | sort -V) "${1}/merged.layer.1/7-${i}.jpg";
done;

convert +append $(ls -1 "${1}/merged.layer.1/*.jpg" | sort -V) ${1}.jpg
```

# Final thoughts
Yes, you can send them an email to ask nicely for this picture. At this point i don't have any idea if they charge something for that. I heard rumours you get them without any costs, if you don't want to use them in a commercial manner. They really ask rigorous questions about the usage part. And you have to sign a form for that.

If you want to look at the map, i would highly suggest using the online viewer provided: [http://chartae-antiquae.cz/](http://chartae-antiquae.cz/)

We wanted to print and this was not possible without downloading unfortunately. Waiting wasn't an option either. Tight timeline for a present and a final DinA0 print.

so long
